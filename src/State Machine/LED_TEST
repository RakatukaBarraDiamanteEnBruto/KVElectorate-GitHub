Notes:

This manus code is pretty usefull as it lets us just create quite simple state machine.
Its just that the dofferent states transitions will have to be coded inside the on_enter_<state> functions.
The state machine is initialized in the IDLE state. The transition_to method is used to change states.
Except for the IDLE state, all other states have entry and exit actions defined. Meaning only in IDLE should input from the user be accepted.
The state machine is designed to handle transitions between states and perform actions based on the current state. 

As such the idle state should operate from a while loop that checks for input from the user.
Such as:

    def _on_enter_idle(self):
       Actions to perform when entering IDLE state.
        print("Entering IDLE state: System in standby mode")
        # Turn on all tower lights
        # Reset error message
        self.error_message = None
        while True:
            print("Waiting for input...")
            user_input = input("Please enter a value: ")
                If user_input == 1:
                    transition_to(State.PRECHECK_DINAMIC)
                elif user_input == -1:
                    transition_to(State.PRECHECK_STATIC)
         TempControl()
        # This would be the loop for idle were it checks for input from the user and then runs temp control
